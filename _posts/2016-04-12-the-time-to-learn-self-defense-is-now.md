# The Time to Learn SELF DEFENSE is NOW

My name is Lisa Trujillo.  You can call me "Tru." I have been studying martial arts since 1989 when I wanted to avoid trying to force myself to work out in a gym.  I thought that if I was taking a class, I would work harder because there would be someone telling me what to do and holding me accountable for working hard.  That was one reason--my public reason for joining Tae Kwon Do at Paek's Black Belt Academy in University Place, WA.  I had another much more private reason though, and I did not share this reason publicly until now.

I joined a martial arts class because I wanted to learn how to protect myself...to make sure that what had happened to me would never happen again.  

I was eighteen years old, a punk rock kid with a purple mohawk who played bass in a band and who was living away from home in a punk rock house with roommates much older than I.  

They were into music, of course, but they were into some pretty bad drugs, as well.  I was brought up in a sheltered, religious environment and didn't know anything about drugs other than what I heard from friends or guessed.  I had been so sheltered that once I tasted complete freedom mixed with the presence of these older friends with drug issues, I was over my head but didn't realize it.  I thought I would "try anything once" and figured the worst thing that could happen to me would be that I would get addicted to these drugs and then when I quit I would suffer withdrawals like having the flu--no big deal.

How terribly mistaken I was.  I made adult decisions with an adolescent mind.  Poor decisions.  The kind of decisions made by young people who don't truly understand the consequences until it's too late.  For me, I soon came face to face with the consequences of choosing to take certain drugs: I became addicted.  And let me tell you that when I tried to quit the first time, what I experienced made the flu look like a wonderful alternative. 

Withdrawals put my mind and body into the most terrible state imaginable.  In fact, I could never have imagined how terrible until I felt them.  I couldn't stand to feel that way, and I would do just about anything to avoid it.  

That was how I became trapped.  Through my constant need for these drugs, I put myself in dangerous situations that I never would have put myself in otherwise.  One such situation resulted in a sexual assault.

I entered a building in Seattle's International District in order to buy drugs.  The minute I entered, I knew I was unsafe.  But the drive to accomplish what I went in there for was stronger than the alarm going off inside me and screaming at me to get out of there immediately.

Instead I went up the stairs lined with men just standing around...watching me.  I found the door I was looking for, and I was invited inside.  Against all better judgement, I went in.  As soon as the door was shut behind me I felt something sharp poking my neck.  I could tell it was a screwdriver...capable of killing me if jabbed into my neck.

I made a silent decision to live.  I would pretend I didn't care and wasn't bothered by anything that was going to happen so that I could get out without making this man believe I was going to try to call the police or do anything that would get him into trouble and therefore give him the motivation to make sure I didn't exit the building alive.

I was assaulted and then given my drugs and allowed to leave.  My friend was waiting outside to pick me up.  I got into the car and didn't say anything about what had just happened in there.

Later that evening, after I had taken the drugs and wasn't feeling sick anymore, I asked my friend to drive me to the UW hospital emergency room because I needed to be checked out.

I went through the post-rape examination and testing.  I don't think I cried.  I was determined not to give that man any more power over me or my life.  I would not allow myself to feel like a victim.  I had made a bad choice and I suffered the consequences.  By no means am I saying I deserved what happened because I absolutely did not.  I did have to accept the repercussions of my choice.  But I didn't have to let it ruin my life.

I was eventually able to recover from my addiction, and I decided it was finally time for me to get back on the path I was meant to be on and go to college.  I started to make healthy choices for my life, and one of these choices was my choice to learn martial arts.

I stayed with it until I earned my black belt.  I was nearly ready to take my second degree black belt promotion test when Master Paek moved to Arizona and the academy was closed.  

I spent the next few years not practicing, until 1997, when I was in my first quarter of my new teaching job at a local community college.  A student in class wrote a paragraph about being a Master of a martial arts style from his home country of Vietnam.  It was called

I spoke to him about my passion for martial arts and he invited me to come see his class practice at a community center.  I went to watch and was immediately hooked.  I wanted to learn the things they were doing, and I joined the class.  

I worked my way up to the equivalent of a third degree black belt (their color rankings are different) and here I am today, hoping to teach self defense strategies to whomever wants to learn.  

This is not about sports.  It is about fitness in the sense  that moving the body and doing the techniques is a healthy thing and leads to better all-around strength and fitness, but mostly it is about training the mind and body to react in predictable and effective ways in response to sudden attacks.

We explore ways in which we can use our bodies and everyday items as defensive tools and offensive weapons.  We create a community of support, and form bonds with our classmates.  We foster positive self esteem and a sense of empowerment.

If this sounds like something you have been thinking about doing or something that sounds like a good choice for you to make for yourself and your loved ones, sign up to receive more information and an invitation to join our upcoming course.

We are in the last stages of finalizing our location and preparing for our spring session to begin.  Just fill in your information and we will make sure you are informed as soon as the location and dates are finalized.
