I have been studying martial arts since 1989 when I wanted to avoid trying to force myself to work out in a gym.  I thought that if I was taking a class, I would work harder because there would be someone telling me what to do and holding me accountable for working hard.  That was one reason--my public reason for joining Tae Kwon Do at Paek's Black Belt Academy in University Place, WA.  I had another much more private reason though, and I did not share this reason publicly until now.</p><p>I joined a martial arts class because I wanted to learn how to protect myself...to make sure that what had happened to me would never happen again.  </p><p>I was eighteen years old, a punk rock kid with a purple mohawk who played bass in a band and who was living away from home in a punk rock house with roommates much older than I.  </p><p>They were into music, of course, but they were into some pretty bad drugs, as well.  I was brought up in a sheltered, religious environment and didn't know anything about drugs other than what I heard from friends or guessed.  I had been so sheltered that once I tasted complete freedom mixed with the presence of these older friends with drug issues, I was over my head but didn't realize it.  I thought I would "try anything once" and figured the worst thing that could happen to me would be that I would get addicted to these drugs and then when I quit I would suffer withdrawals like having the flu--no big deal.</p><p>How terribly mistaken I was.  I made adult decisions with an adolescent mind.  Poor decisions.  The kind of decisions made by young people who don't truly understand the consequences until it's too late.  For me, I soon came face to face with the consequences of choosing to take certain drugs: I became addicted.  And let me tell you that when I tried to quit the first time, what I experienced made the flu look like a wonderful alternative. </p><p> Withdrawals put my mind and body into the most terrible state imaginable.  In fact, I could never have imagined how terrible until I felt them.  I couldn't stand to feel that way, and I would do just about anything to avoid it.  </p><p>That was how I became trapped.  Through my constant need for these drugs, I put myself in dangerous situations that I never would have put myself in otherwise.  One such situation resulted in a sexual assault.</p><p>I entered a building in Seattle's International District in order to buy drugs.  The minute I entered, I knew I was unsafe.  But the drive to accomplish what I went in there for was stronger than the alarm going off inside me and screaming at me to get out of there immediately.</p><p>Instead I went up the stairs lined with men just standing around...watching me.  I found the door I was looking for, and I was invited inside.  Against all better judgement, I went in.  As soon as the door was shut behind me I felt something sharp poking my neck.  I could tell it was a screwdriver...capable of killing me if jabbed into my neck.</p><p>I made a silent decision to live.  I would pretend I didn't care and wasn't bothered by anything that was going to happen so that I could get out without making this man believe I was going to try to call the police or do anything that would get him into trouble and therefore give him the motivation to make sure I didn't exit the building alive.</p><p>I was assaulted and then given my drugs and allowed to leave.  My friend was waiting outside to pick me up.  I got into the car and didn't say anything about what had just happened in there.</p><p>Later that evening, after I had taken the drugs and wasn't feeling sick anymore, I asked my friend to drive me to the UW hospital emergency room because I needed to be checked out.</p><p>I went through the post-rape examination and testing.  I don't think I cried.  I was determined not to give that man any more power over me or my life.  I would not allow myself to feel like a victim.  I had made a bad choice and I suffered the consequences.  By no means am I saying I deserved what happened because I absolutely did not.  I did have to accept the repercussions of my choice.  But I didn't have to let it ruin my life.</p><p>I was eventually able to recover from my addiction, and I decided it was finally time for me to get back on the path I was meant to be on and go to college.  I started to make healthy choices for my life, and one of these choices was my choice to learn martial arts.</p><p>I stayed with it until I earned my black belt.  I was nearly ready to take my second degree black belt promotion test when Master Paek moved to Arizona and the academy was closed.  </p><p>I spent the next few years not practicing, until 1997, when I was in my first quarter of my new teaching job at a local community college.  A student in class wrote a paragraph about being a Master of a martial arts style from his home country of Vietnam.  It was called</p><picture>
